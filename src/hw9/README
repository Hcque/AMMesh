# The implenmention of mesh simplification described in "Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics";

I get familiarity on Eigen and various data structures. Particularity , I combine the hash table and priority queue to achieve O(1) entry deletion.
Other exploration detail:
1) to try different terms on the error function when selecting edges to eliminate. 
2) dfs, with bounded depth , for selection indirected neighbour edges with topological adjacency.

The speed of this algorithm tested on a 50000-facets dragon model (with simplify ratio 0.001) needs 10s on my machine. 
For details please see the report.pdf

The result on glimpse:
