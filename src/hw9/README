# The implenmenting the mesh simplification described in "Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics";

I gets familiarity on Eigen and various data structures. Particularity , I combine the hash table and priority queue to achieve O(1) entry deletion.
Other exploration detail:
1) to try different terms on the error function when selecting edges to eliminate. 
2) dfs, with bounded depth , for selection indirected neighbour edges 

The speed of this algorithm tested on 50000 dragon model for simplify ratio 0.001 needs 10s.

The result on glimpse:
